# Taxi-App (TaxiTaxi)

Welcome to our Taxi Reservation System! <br/>
This system allows users to easily book a taxi, and choose from a variety of taxi types, including eco, standard, and luxury. There are some differences in Web -Application and Application. That's why we've divided them into branches (main , web , application), for greater clarity.
<br>
For more detailed information we have added README files for Web-application and Application.
You can access it from the links below.

<br />
Main branch contains these files: Project Proposal, Software Requirements, Software Engineering (Documentation) and some photos related to the project. <br/>
